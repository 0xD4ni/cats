# Warding off Macavity through Threat Modeling
*Building a personal threat model to shore up against stalkers told through Cats the Musical.*

Resources to coincide with my PancakesCon5 talk: Warding off Macavity throug Threat Modeling

## Watch Cats the Musical:
The 1998 proshot is availale on DVD and Blueray, and can be streamed via Amazon Prime and Apple TV. But about virtually the entire film has been uploaded as individual songs to the official Cats the Musical Youtube channel. For that last one I've created a playlist with all the fragments strung together.

## Listen to Cats the Musical
There are several cast recordings available, next to the original English language London and Broadway versions I've listed a more recent cast recording from the 2019-2022 production in Vienna. It might be in German, but it is a complete live recording that includes songs omitted from other recordings, and it has the biggest orchestration. If you're listening for the poetry and lyrics I recommend either English version, if you're listening for the music I highly recommend the Vienna version
